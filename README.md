Milestone 2 update.  

1) The front-end engineer completed the creation of the dashboard design. The design

can be found with the following path in github repo:  

dashboard_design/design.pdf  

Or alternatively it can be found by the following google drive link that is shared with  

the instructor:  [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/#G1_A8RPBToDKyv-RBb4rSJMD06Td9Q8Xaq)

There are two options to go with, and we are inclined to go with option 2 (case 2 in the   

diagram).  

2) The data analyst and data scientist completed the codes for scraping the data from

zangak web page, cleaned the dataset and translated it. The source codes can be found   

in directory src, and there are executable shell scripts written at the root directory for   

convenience of use. An important note is that after each scraping a small manual work is  

needed before running the second executable. The datasets are not typically pushed to

github, therefore, we provide a google drive link where:

zangak_scrape must have been in data/raw_scraped/

zangak_match must have been in data/book_text_matched/

zangak_translate must have been in data/translated/

The link: [MA group project data - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1y6EMNzfI1V4WGgsLltSNStKR4yxrrCZN)

IMPORTANT NOTE: Since the translation script is running long, the dataframe in 

folder zangak_translate is just a sample to demonstrate what the result will look like.

The script is running on the whole dataset by the time of pushing current work to github,  

and the sample folder will be replaced by the original one on google drive as the script 

completes running.

Finding a book one will love reading can be difficult with so many options available.
A recommendation system can make the process quicker and more effective. They can make
reading more personalized and effective for users by introducing them to books they
might not have otherwise come across. Our book recommender system is a form of
recommender system where the user inputs a name of a book that he/she liked and
the system provides books that are similar to the one that is in the input. This will
help a user to see the suggested related books to the one the user wants to find.
Overall, our book recommendation system will help our users to save time, effort, and
it will increase user satisfaction.

The general idea of our project is that first, we are going to scrape the descriptions
of books from the Internet. As a source of our data, we decided to scrape data from
Zangakâ€™s webpage, where for each book there is a short description. After that we are
going to obtain the NLP embeddings for each description. The method of obtaining the
embeddings will be decided later, for now we have two ideas, the first one is that for
each book we will obtain an embedding for the description text as a whole and the
second idea is that for each book we will take embeddings of each of the words in the
description and calculate their mean and consider it as the embedding of the
description. Finally, when we have one vector for each book (the embeddings discussed
above) we will make a dashboard where the user will input the book that he/she liked
and then, the dashboard will take the embedding of the input book, calculate its dot
product with the embeddings of all other books, and then the books for which the dot
product will be the highest will be recommended.
